Aeron:
- fix nuget package for mock framework
- Implement FilePoll (see Image, Subscription and IFileBlockHandler)
- CommonContext: aeron directory should be configurable (see comments in CommonContext)
- LogBuffers does not properly dispose memory mapped files

Agrona:
 - UnsafeBuffer does not currently implement VerifyAlignment (also needs to be tested in AtomicBufferTests)
 - Decide how to best handle buffer pinning/unpinning in UnsafeBuffer

Performance:
  - ByteUtil.MemoryCopy to be benchmarked against other implementations
  - UnsafeBuffer.SetMemory should be reviewed, currently uses a naive implementation
